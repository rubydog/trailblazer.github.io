  <h2 class="text-center">Finally know where to put your code!</h2>

  Trailblazer gives you a high-level architecture for web applications. It extends the basic MVC pattern with new abstractions. Rock-solid conventions that go far beyond database table naming or route paths let you focus on your application code, minimize bugs and improve the maintainability.

  Trailblazer's file structure organizes by **CONCEPT**, and then by technology.

  * **THOUSANDS** of users find this more intuitive and easier to navigate.
  * It embraces the **COMPONENT STRUCTURE** of your code.
  * Huge teams working on complex projects have it easier not to get into each others' way.
  * Once a concept's **CODE IS TESTED** it won't break anywhere else.
  * The modular structure **SIMPLIFIES REFACTORING** in hundreds of legacy production apps.
  ~~~3,end
  The new abstractions in Trailblazer are optional. Only use what you need.

  * **CONTRACT** Form objects to validate incoming data.
  * **POLICY** to authorize code execution per user.
  * **OPERATION** A service object implementation with functional flow control.
  * **VIEW MODEL** Components for your view code.
  * **REPRESENTER** for serializing and parsing API documents.
  * **DESERIALIZER** Transformers to parse incoming data into structures you can work with.

<h4>
  <i class="fa fa-gamepad"></i>
  Framework-agnostic
</h4>

The Trailblazer gems work with any Ruby framework. We provide glue code for Rails and Hanami, but there are TRB-powered apps in Roda, Grape, Sinatra and many more out there.

~~~4
<h4>
  <i class="fa fa-university"></i>
  Legacy-ready
</h4>

You can start using Trailblazer in existing, massive applications today. Refactorings can be applied step-wise, legacy code can be minimized as you go. Remember: Rome wasn't build in one day, either.

~~~4
<h4>
  <i class="fa fa-leaf"></i>
  Future-compatible
</h4>

Our promise to the community: Trailblazer 2 will be supported until end of 2020 or longer. Our API design makes it easy to provide automatic upgrading and backward-compatibility so you won't have to change code when we ship updates.

{% endrow %}


  {% row quarters %}

<h4>
  <i class="fa fa-recycle"></i>
  Build to Refactor
</h4>

Our patterns are developed to be used in highly complex, existing, messy legacy applications. Trailblazer is designed to refactor old code - you do not have to rewrite the entire system to get a better architecture.
~~~4
<h4>
  <i class="fa fa-dashboard"></i>
  Test first
</h4>

By restructuring business code, application behavior can be tested more efficiently with more unit and less integration tests. Trailblazer engineers do enjoy the simplicity of testing and the speedup of the test suites.
~~~4
<h4>
  <i class="fa fa-ship"></i>
  It's real!
</h4>

Trailblazer is in use in thousands of production applications. Our patterns have evolved over a decade of engineering, our gems are mature and battle-tested. And: we will never stop innovating.

    class SongsController < ApplicationController
      def create
        run Comment::Update do |result|
          redirect_to songs_path(result["model"])
        end
      end
    end
~~~5
**CONTROLLER** They end up as lean HTTP endpoints. No business logic is to be found in the controller, they instantly delegate to their respective operation.

Oh, and did we say there won't be controller tests anymore? That's right. Only unit and integration tests.
~~~1
{% endrow %}

{% row grey %}
~~~4,medium-offset-1
**MODEL** Models contain associations, scopes and finders. Only persistence logic, no callbacks, no validations, no business logic here.

    class Song < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many   :albums
      belongs_to :composer
    end

Any number of **POLICY**s can be used in an operation to grant or deny access to functionality.

    class Application::Policy < Pundit::Policy
      def create?
        user.can_create?(model)
      end
    end

Also, use your choice of authorization framework.

~~~6,end
The **OPERATION** is the heart of the Trailblazer architecture. It orchestrates validations, policies, models, callback and business logic by leveraging a functional pipeline with built-in error handling.

    class Song::Create < Trailblazer::Operation
      step Model( Song, :new )
      step Policy::Pundit( Application::Policy, :create? )
      step Contract::Build( constant: Song::Contract::Create )
      step Contract::Validate()
      step Contract::Persist()
      fail Notifier::DBError
      step :update_song_count!

      def update_song_count!(options, current_user:, **)
        current_user.increment_song_counter
      end
    end

Designed to be a stateless object, the operation passes around one mutable options hash and makes heavy use of Ruby keyword arguments - if you want it.
{% endrow %}

{% row %}
~~~5,medium-offset-1
    class Song::Contract::Create < Reform::Form
      property :title
      property :length

      validates :title, presence: true
    end
~~~5,end
Validations are implemented with **CONTRACT**.

Trailblazer supports Reform and `Dry::Schema` validations in any number.
{% endrow %}

{% row %}
  ~~~4,medium-offset-1
  Any dependency, such as the current user, must be [injected from the outside](/gems/operation/2.0/api.html#dependency-injection).

  The concept of global state does not exist in Trailblazer, which leads to simplified, mock-free testability and concurrent-ready code.

  ~~~6,end
  **And the best:** there's only one way to run an operation.

    Song::Create.(
      { title: "Roxanne", length: 300 }, # params
      "current_user": current_user       # dependencies
    )
{% endrow %}

{% row %}
  ~~~5,medium-offset-1
    describe Song::Create do
      it "prohibits empty params" do
        result = Song::Create.({})

        expect(result).to be_failure
        expect(result["model"]).to be_new
      end
    end
  ~~~4,end
  Clumsy, slow controller tests are history. Now that all your business logic is controlled by the operation, **SIMPLE UNIT TESTS** can test any edge-case scenario or avoid regressions.

  Trailblazer's encapsulation makes a programmer's life better.
